# SQLAlchemy Challenge Work : Trips to Hawaii

# Introduction

Finally, we've decided to treat ourselves to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
To help us with our trip planning, we need to do some climent analysis on the area, using sqlalchemy.

## Exploring and Analyzing Climate Data

* In Jupyter Notebook, use SQLAlchemy to execute the basic climate analysis and data exploration of our climate database. 

* Following analysis is done by using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

* In the data analysis, includes summary of the precipitation data, station analysis, graphs, charts, and climate flask app.
